**About the Project**
This application was built using the following technologies and tools:

-   Laravel as the PHP framework.
-   Blade for templating.
-   Tailwind CSS for styling.
-   FullCalendar for displaying and managing the production schedule.
-   Shared Components for modular and reusable frontend elements.
-   Controller-Service-Model-Route Architecture for structured backend development.
-   PHPStan Integration [https://phpstan.org/](https://phpstan.org/).

PHPStan can be integrated into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automatically verify the code on every push. This helps maintain a robust and error-free codebase.
